# Profiler

I call it the Profiler because it scrapes any digital data about someone and performs all the background checks automatically to build a profile. Its aim is to produce results with 90+ percent accuracy, such as phone numbers, addresses and work status. It could be dangerous, so use it cautiously. However, I don't consider it unethical, as all the data it could ever find was exposed by the user to the internet in the first place; all it does is organize it.

# Progress...

So at the moment I can scrap all google result of a particular target and save them in the database, should I repeat the search, instead of scrapping from google, it will load the results from db so I can process it.

I haven't done any data processing yet, but NLP is the great choice, a little bit if stanford CoreNLP and Spring.ai will do the trick.

In there, I can also automatically log into facebook and linkedin and search our targets. But due to other priotities, I've stopped here. Wait for more updates.Should you choose to contribute, you where to find me.

# Inspiration

I have long lost friends to find, also I got the inspiration from movies. 
Realising fiction is my goal. So instead of waiting for someone else to give me their system, I'm making mine.
