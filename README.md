# Profiler

I call it the Profiler because it scrapes any digital data about someone and performs all the background checks automatically. It could be dangerous, so use it cautiously. However, I don't consider it unethical, as all the data it could ever find was exposed by the user to the internet in the first place; all it does is organize it.
